```

Configure different methods for authentication in `~/.steampipe/config/aiven.spc`:

```hcl
connection "aiven" {
  plugin = "aiven"

  # You can connect to Aiven using one of the options below:

  # API Token authentication
  # api_token(required) = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  # user_agent(optional) = "aiven-go-client/v1.2.0"

  # User authentication
  # email(required) = "test@turbot.com"
  # password(required) = "test@123"
  # user_agent(optional) = "aiven-go-client/v1.2.0"


  # MFA User authentication
  # email(required) = "test@turbot.com"
  # password(required) = "test@123"
  # otp(required) = "123456"
  # user_agent(optional) = "aiven-go-client/v1.2.0"
}
```

Run steampipe:

```shell
steampipe query
```

Query your account:

```sql
select
  id,
  name,
  billing_enabled,
  tenant_id
from
  aiven_account;
```

```
