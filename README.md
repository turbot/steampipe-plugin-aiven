## Quick start

Install the plugin with [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io):

```shell
steampipe plugin install aiven
```

Configure different methods for authentication in `~/.steampipe/config/aiven.spc`:

```hcl
connection "aiven" {
  plugin = "aiven"

  # You can connect to Aiven using one of options below:

  # Use API Key authentication
  # `api_key` (required) - Create an authentication token in the Aiven Console for use with the Aiven CLI or API.
  # To learn more about using authentication tokens, refer to https://docs.aiven.io/docs/platform/concepts/authentication-tokens
  # Can also be set with the AIVEN_TOKEN environment variable.
  # api_key = "oGAxUvrjAdL3QBhWnaJI67Pc9P0rPDzDfhykzVfBYPlmvVH8WdJMKaeVKzcrl4CnyXpjiaKJCCNT+OkbpxfWdDNqwZPngS"

  # Use User authentication
  # email = "test@turbot.com"
  # password = "test@123"

  # If no credentials are specified, the plugin will use Aiven CLI authentication.
  # We recommend using API Key authentication for MFA user.
}
```

Run steampipe:

```shell
steampipe query
```

Query your account:

```sql
select
  id,
  name,
  billing_enabled,
  tenant_id
from
  aiven_account;
```

```
